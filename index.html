                <p>
                    Qram stands for "Queued Rebase and Merge" and rhymes nicely with "cram", nudging you to work more on
                    meaningful things and leave cramming commits into neat chains to robots.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Much like Gitlab's
                    <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/merge_trains.html">Merge trains</a>
                    and Github's recently introduced
                    <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2023-02-08-pull-request-merge-queue-public-beta/">Merge queues</a>,
                    Qram strives to provide a solution for testing multiple PRs in conjunction to
                    detect conflicts, but targets a specific opinionated workflow:
                    <ul>
                        <li>commit history in PRs matter, so they get merged and not squashed;</li>
                        <li>linear history in main branch matters too, so PRs have to be rebased
                            on top of each other.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
